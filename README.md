# Midterm for Web Development MMED 1056
By David Gonzales

## This repo is my FIP Midterm assignment. The contents include: 
(No Folder)
A contact page
An index page.

(Assets)
XD Wireframes and webpage inspiration from previous assignment, 
Text Document Outline, 

(CSS)
A CSS main page involving CSS styling, 
A CSS grid page for grid styling, 

I built mobile-first, using the class examples and HW2 as a framework to build from.
It reacts as expected from mobile, to tablet, and desktop. Some more fine-tuning will be required for FIP.
I have validated the code through validator.w3.org
